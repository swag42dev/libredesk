## Features

- **Omnichannel inbox**  
  Live chat and email in one inbox. Every conversation lands in the same place, whichever channel it came from.
- **Live chat widget**  
  Embed a real-time chat widget on your website. Replies go out from the same inbox your team already works in.
- **AI assistant**  
  Answer live chat conversations automatically with an AI assistant grounded in your knowledge base. Hands off to a human when it can't help.
- **Agent copilot**  
  Draft replies, summarize conversations, and look up answers from the knowledge base without leaving the inbox.
- **Automations**  
  Rules that run on conversation events. Tag, assign, and route conversations based on conditions you define.
- **Granular permissions**  
  Role-based access control. Create custom roles with per-action permissions for teams and individual agents.
- **CSAT & analytics**  
  Send CSAT surveys automatically after a conversation closes. Track response times, resolution rates, and agent activity.
- **Custom attributes**  
  Create custom attributes for contacts or conversations such as the subscription plan or the date of their first purchase.
- **Macros**  
  Save replies you send often. One macro can send the message, set tags, and assign the conversation to a team.
- **Organization**  
  Tags, custom statuses, and snoozing to keep the inbox in order. Search covers every conversation.
- **Auto assignment**  
  Assign incoming conversations automatically, based on agent capacity or on criteria you define.
- **SLA management**  
  Set and track response time targets. Get notified when conversations are at risk of breaching SLA commitments.
- **SSO logins**  
  Google, Microsoft, and any OIDC provider are supported out of the box.
- **API**  
  HTTP/JSON APIs and webhooks for custom integrations and workflows.
- **Activity logs**  
  Track all actions performed by agents and admins, for auditing and accountability.
- **Command bar**  
  Opens with a simple shortcut (CTRL+K) and lets you quickly perform actions on conversations.
